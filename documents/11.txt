Locksmith

What do they do?

Locksmiths provide security for homes, businesses and other assets. Locksmiths secure premises and provide security advice as well as open jammed or broken locks, make replacement keys, unlock vehicles, buildings or safes and help law enforcement agencies with evictions, repossessions, search warrants and forensic investigations.


A typical day

Sometimes an eight-hour day; sometimes on shift work rosters or on call.

Work can include discussing clients' security needs through to replacing lost keys or cracking a safe. Typically, you travel to the client's location so you're often on the move. Your clients could be private owners or law enforcement agencies depending on the company.

You may also be involved in providing security advice, for example, alarm systems.
