Traineeships

What is a traineeship?

A Competenz traineeship is a structured programme that combines practical and technical training. Traineeships typically take 6-18 months to complete and range from entry level to advanced.

They are formal arrangements between an employer, learner, and Competenz. Traineeships lead to a nationally recognised New Zealand qualification.

Anyone can do a traineeship

You just need to be 16 years of age or older and be a New Zealand citizen or have New Zealand residency and the right to work in New Zealand. Employees already working in your business without formal qualifications can have their skills formally recognised.

Keeping the costs manageable

Competenz receives government funding which subsidises the costs of traineeships for employers.
