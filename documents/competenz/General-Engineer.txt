General Engineer

What do they do?

General engineers have good broad skills and knowledge of welding, fabrication, machining, and fitting. Their work includes fitting and assembly work, machine shop work, service and repair work, manufacturing and general fabrication of all kinds of machines and equipment including hydraulics and pneumatics.

A typical day

Normally an eight-hour day; sometimes working longer may be required.

Each day can be quite different; engineering work is varied and can involve fitting, machining, welding, maintenance, repair, hydraulics, pneumatics and/or fabrication.

Generally, your training will be tailored to the type of work you do.
