Maintenance Engineer

What do they do?

Maintenance engineers are responsible for making sure equipment and machines are reliable and run smoothly. They use computerised systems to oversee routine maintenance and organise repairs.

A typical day

Normally an eight-hour day; sometimes working longer may be required.

Work can include installing and maintaining machinery, shutting down maintenance work (e.g. within engineering, manufacturing, mining industries), making adjustments to meet production requirements, monitoring equipment condition, diagnosis and fault finding. You will usually be working onsite at a production/manufacturing business.
