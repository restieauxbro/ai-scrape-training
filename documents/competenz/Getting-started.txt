Getting started

Do you need to get a job first?

You need to be employed in your chosen industry to start apprenticeship training. If you're not already in a job, we can help you find one. Check out our Find a Job page.

Are you already working?

Your current employer might let you do an apprenticeship. All they need is the right information about how to make it work. Read up on the information for employers here. It will help you reassure your boss that it’s a good idea for both you and them.

If you and your current boss think an apprenticeship is right for you, here's how it works:

 1. Contact us (use the chat bubble at the bottom right of the screen)
 2. We assign you a training advisor
 3. Work with your training advisor to sign up and start planning
 4. Start your on-the-job training
 5. Pass your unit standards
 6. Earn your trade qualification.

Are you still at school?

Do you think an apprenticeship is what you want to do in the future? There are a few things you can do to give yourself the best chance of success.

 * If you start after secondary school
   There are some subjects that teach you useful skills for your apprenticeship training. These include maths, English, science, workshop and design technology, physics, graphics, chemistry, or NCEA Level 1 and Level 2 engineering unit standards.
 * If you start after tertiary study
   You can do a pre-apprenticeship course at a polytechnic or a training company. This will set you up well for your training. This kind of study will be recognised by an employer. If you’ve achieved a minimum of 50 credits, it’s a good indication that you will do well in an apprenticeship.
