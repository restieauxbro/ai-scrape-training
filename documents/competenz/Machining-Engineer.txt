Machining Engineer

What do they do?

Machinists make metal parts using a range of traditional methods and high-tech equipment. Machinists are able to manufacture precision componentry by engineering various materials using a wide range of machining and hand processes; in both large and small volumes.

A typical day

Normally an eight-hour day; sometimes working longer may be required.

Each day can be quite different; machining work is varied and can include making and assembling metal parts.

Using Computer Numerical Controlled (CNC) machines, you could be making componentry in bulk or making small quantities of unique or special parts.
