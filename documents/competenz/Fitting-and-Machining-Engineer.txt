Fitting and Machining Engineer

What do they do?

Fitting and machining engineers make and assemble components for plants and equipment used in New Zealand and overseas. They use modern engineering process and machinery.

A typical day

Normally an eight-hour day; sometimes working longer may be required. Each day can be quite different; fitting and machining work is varied and can include the assembly, alignment and machining of components, plus installation of machines, hydraulic or pneumatic control systems.

Basic Computer Numerical Controlled (CNC) machinery operations are often involved and you could be involved in making prototypes for testing purposes.

Qualifications available

New Zealand Certificate in Mechanical Engineering (Trade) with strands in Fitting and Machining, General Engineering, Machining, Maintenance Engineering and Toolmaking, Level 4

This qualification has been developed by leading New Zealand mechanical engineers to equip staff with the skills and knowledge to work productively and safely.

With technology and automation rapidly driving change in the engineering sector, this qualification is designed with the future in mind so your people can respond and adapt to change.

Most of the learning is practical work completed on-the-job. Apprentices are also required to complete eLearning via our online learning platform Canvas, and attend block courses for two to three weeks each year.

Speak to your training advisor or account manager for details on programme and resource pricing.

All graduates will be able to:

 * Understand relevant health and safety legislation and workplace safety culture
 * Interpret drawings and specifications and use the appropriate materials, processes, tools and equipment for the task 
 * Apply knowledge of relevant engineering principles and practices, and problem solving skills, to perform engineering tasks to industry standards
 * Use effective and efficient processes, principles and quality systems to produce components and provide services in a commercial mechanical engineering environment 
 * Communicate effectively within a team and the wider workplace
