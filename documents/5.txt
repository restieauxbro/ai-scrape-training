Toolmaker

What do they do?

Toolmakers make moulds, dies, gauges, jigs, tooling and fixtures for industrial processes. Many common household items such as aerosol cans and plastic bottles are produced from tooling. Tooling is typically used in injection moulding, blow moulding, extrusion, and pressure die-casting operations.


A typical day

Normally an eight-hour day; sometimes working longer may be required.

Work can include design and manufacturing moulds, dies, or casts for mass-production product containers (for example paint and aerosol cans) as well as designing and manufacturing one-off tools needed within an industry.

You'll learn CAD/CAM design programs, and also CNC or EDM machining using computers.
