Cellarhand


What do they do?

Cellarhands process picked grapes and ensure wine production is high quality and ready for bottling. They work alongside the winemaker who manages and monitors all stages of the winemaking process.


A typical day

Typically, an eight-hour day or shift work.

During the vintage from February to April, they evaluate grape quality, operate crushers and pressers, and manage the first stage of wine processing. During the rest of the year they filter, operate cross flows, control chemical additions and work with the winemakers to ensure the blend of the wine meets specification.
