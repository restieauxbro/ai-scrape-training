Metal Forming / Casting

What do they do?

Metal casting engineers produce parts from molten metal and test, control and adjust the chemical make-up of the metal. They use traditional and modern techniques and a high level of skill.

A typical day

Normally an eight-hour day; sometimes working longer may be required.

Work can include reading, interpreting and creating design drawings, producing replicas, before making moulds, selecting the metals, inspecting, testing and repairing castings, then tempering, hardening, polishing and coating the final product.

You will learn about all sorts of materials; metals, woods, clays, plastics and resins.

Qualifications available

New Zealand Certificate in Metal Forming (Trade), Level 4

This qualification is designed to enable trainees/apprentices employed in the metal casting discipline of engineering to gain recognition for the relevant skills and knowledge required by industry.

The qualification represents a set of foundation skills for mechanical engineering and specific skills in metal casting and engineering pattern making. Metal casting embraces moulding and pattern making skills. Technological advances have initiated a convergence of these historical trades: it is impossible for either to exist in isolation. People awarded this qualification can use the tools and make castings or patterns/tooling applicable to metal casting.
