Because of this, employers are confident that Competenz qualifications are current and fit for purpose.\n\n \n\nGo straight from school into an apprenticeship\n\nAt Competenz we’re all about industry training – you earn money while you are learning.\n\nYou can start a mechanical engineering apprenticeship (level 4) straight from school.

The next step is for your employer to agree you can start an engineering apprenticeship with us.\n\nMost apprenticeships take around four years to complete and our Competenz training advisors are with you every step of the way.

When you enrol in an apprenticeship through this pathway, we know the unit standards you have achieved in your level 3 qualification. \n\nThis makes it easier for Competenz or your employer to see the skills you have and what you can already do. It also means we might be able to fast-track you into year two of your apprenticeship. Your total time in the apprenticeship reduces to just three years, and that’s a win for you as well as your employer.\n\nMy polytech isn't listed – what does that mean?\n\nIf you complete a level 3 qualification at another polytech, that's okay too.

{"prompt":"","completion":"Apprenticeships\n\nWhat is an apprenticeship?\n\nAn apprenticeship allows you to get a formal qualification and hands-on experience while working and getting paid. An apprenticeship is not an internship. While there are some similarities between the two, an apprenticeship is usually three to four years. Once you have completed your apprenticeship training, you’ll end up with an NZQA qualification recognised around the world, and you can be fully qualified within three to four years.\n\nIf you’ve ever dreamed of owning your own business, an apprenticeship can be a smart first step towards becoming your own boss. And your qualification will also be globally recognised, meaning you have the potential to find work all over the world. \n\nWho can do an apprenticeship?\n\nAnyone can do an apprenticeship if they’re aged 16 or older. You might be leaving school, or you might be already working. You might even be able to train as an apprentice with your current employer. If you’re already working and have built up some skills, you can have them formally recognised as part of your training.\n\nIf you want to do an apprenticeship, you need to: \n\n * Be a New Zealand citizen or resident OR\n * Be legally entitled to live and work in New Zealand for the duration of your training agreement period\n * Hold a current driver licence.\n\nThe best part? Earn while you learn – there’s no student loan \n\nYou’ll get qualified without a student loan, all while learning practical skills from industry experts. You can put that money towards something else you really want – might be a new car, new tools or a new house.\n\nHow long does an apprenticeship take?\n\nIt depends on how quickly your employer can teach you, how fast you learn and how committed you are. The average time is 3 to 4 years.\n\nHow it works\n\nAn apprenticeship is work-based learning where your employer trains you. So the first step is getting employed in your chosen industry, and then it goes like this:\n\n * Contact Competenz with your employer \n * Get assigned to a Training Advisor\n * Work with your Training Advisor to sign up and plan your career path\n * Start on-the-job training\n * Study to pass your unit standards\n * Become a qualified tradesperson!\n\nPrevious\n\nJob seekers\n\nNext\n\nGetting work ready\n\nStarting an apprenticeship is about getting getting employed and training on-the-job. We help keen learners get ready for work."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"About us\n\nCompetenz is one of New Zealand’s work based learning organisations. We arrange training for apprenticeships and other on-the-job qualifications, supporting employers, job seekers and people with jobs in our industries. We are a business division within Te Pūkenga Work Based Learning Limited. \n\nWe work with more than 3,500 companies and 12,000 learners in 37 industries around New Zealand each year to build skills, careers and businesses. To do this, we partner with employers, apprentices, schools, training providers and assessors across the country. \n\n \n\nTailored training\n\nOur account managers are specialists in their fields. They work with companies to build training plans tailored to their businesses – then help their learners gain skills in the workplace. \n\nMaking the learning happen\n\nOur Competenz team:\n\n * provides training materials and eLearning\n * visits workplaces to check on progress\n * arranges for learners to complete any off-job training they need (e.g. at a polytechnic)\n * assesses (or arrange assessments) to confirm learners have built their skills\n * moderates assessments to make sure they are fair, valid and consistent across the country\n * registers learners’ success with the New Zealand Qualifications Authority.\n\nSupporting our industries\n\nWe also support our industries in many ways, including promoting careers in these industries, sponsoring industry events like conferences and competitions, offering scholarships and celebrating learners’ success.\n\nWhy train?\n\nTraining is an effective way to build the skills New Zealand businesses and New Zealanders need to get ahead in an increasingly competitive world.\n\nBuilding competitive, safe businesses\n\nTraining helps businesses build the skills needed to:\n\n * operate productively and safely\n * lift quality, and reduce downtime and waste \n * increase employee confidence, satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nAll that means a more competitive New Zealand.\n\nBuilding rewarding careers\n\nEmployees doing apprenticeships and traineeships benefit too. By gaining skills they’re gaining opportunities: to advance their career, increase their earnings, learn new things, and maybe even own their own business and train their own employees one day.\n\nTraining on-the-job has added benefits\n\nTraining in the workplace with the nationally recognised qualifications Competenz supports is an effective way to build skills. Employees:\n\n * learn using their workplace equipment and processes – so the learning’s relevant to the business they work in \n * gain skills that meet industry standards and qualifications that are recognised across New Zealand\n * learn in the workplace – meaning few absences and little downtime.\n\nSupporting our industries\n\nWe partner with industry associations, employers and others in our industries to help recruit and build talented employees. This support includes promoting careers, identifying potential apprentices, and encouraging work placements.\n\nWe also ensure our industries' qualifications continue to meet their needs, offer scholarships to encourage higher learning, support industry events like conferences, and regularly celebrate learners’ success.\n\nThe code of good practice for New Zealand apprenticeships\n\nThe three parties to a New Zealand Apprenticeship\n\nThere are three parties to a New Zealand Apprenticeship - the apprentice, employer and industry training organisation. Each has unique responsibilities.\n\nThe responsibilities of the apprentice are to work and learn. The responsibilities of the employer are to train and support the apprentice. The responsibilities of the industry training organisation are to facilitate the training and support both the apprentice and the employer throughout the apprenticeship.\n\nRead more about the responsibilities of each party\n\nInvestment Plan\n\nView our Investment Plan\n\nNZQA external evaluation and review\n\nView our NZQA external evaluation and review"}

The results of our research help us understand how we can best work with companies, learners, government and our training partners to build skills across New Zealand.\n\nHelping Māori and Pasifika learners build their skills in the workplace\n\nAbout this research project\n\nCompetenz commissioned this research with our research partner, the University of Auckland Business School, to help us understand how we can help our Māori and Pasifika learners build their skills in the workplace. \n \nWe wanted to answer two questions for the 37 industries we support:\n\n * How relevant is a learner’s ethnicity in predicting how likely they are to enrol in and complete a qualification?\n * How can we help our Māori and Pasifika learners build their skills?\n\nWhat we learned\n\nThe compelling issue for our Māori and Pasifika learners is participation\n\n * Outside forestry, our Māori learners are enrolling in industry training at a rate that is considerably lower than the rate at which they participate in the workforce (3.9% in trades, 7.7% in traineeships, 12% in the workforce)\n * Our Pasifika learners are enrolling in workplace trades training at a rate that is considerably lower than the rate at which they participate in the workforce, and in traineeships training at a rate that is well ahead (3.2% in trades, 14% in traineeships, 4.9% in the workforce).\n\nEthnicity does not predict whether our learners complete their trades or traineeships qualifications\n\n * Our Māori and Pasifika learners complete their qualifications at the same rate as learners of other ethnicities\n * Other factors such as the learner’s age, prior qualifications or programme of study are more relevant than ethnicity in predicting whether the learner will succeed.\n\nMost of the factors which help our Māori and Pasifika learners complete their qualifications, and the factors that make it hard for them to complete, are common to all our learners\n\n * This means the approach Competenz has taken in the past five years of identifying and supporting all struggling learners, regardless of their ethnicity, has been (and continues to be) the right one.\n\nHow we are acting on the results of this research\n\nWe have three clear priorities. Most of these activities will benefit all our learners, whatever their ethnicity.\n \nPriority one: career paths\nWe need to promote workplace learning and careers in the trades by: \n•         lifting the perception of the trades as worthwhile careers\n•         working with Māori and Pasifika communities in appropriate ways\n•         using successful Māori and Pasifika learners as role models and ambassadors\n•         contributing to a smooth transition between school and the workforce for trades.\n \nPriority two: assessments and book work\nWe need to improve our assessment and study materials and our assessment processes by:\n•         making our assessment materials simpler\n•         making our assessment processes and tools more accessible to learners\n•         making our study materials more engaging and relevant to learners.\n \nPriority three: support for our learners\nWe need to continue to identify and support our struggling learners by:\n•         supporting them with appropriate pastoral care\n•         helping them build their literacy skills\n•         working closely with employers to model and promote good work practices and work ethic.\n \nWe need to support all these activities by building stronger cultural partnerships and understanding\n•         We need to develop stronger partnerships with Māori and Pasifika community groups and training providers \n•         We need to broaden and deepen cultural understanding across Competenz. \n \n\nHelping Māori and Pasifika learners build their skills in the workplace"}
